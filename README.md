# Springboard_Capstone_1
Ideas for first Capstone:

1. A communications and logistics website/application targeting Property Management companies (think apartments, rentals, etc) and the lessees. Through this website the PM companies can send notifications regarding upcoming maintenance, payment reminders, lease information and other general occurrences. The website will also facilitate a per location ticketing service/queue and log of service requests and/or issues submitted by lessees that the management company can act upon based on severity and time. Furthermore, with the help of the website [and database] the PM companies can advertise vacant properties and facilitate walk-throughs with interested parties and future lessees.

2. A community-based communications app like Facebook/Twitter. The user(s) register as residing in a particular area. While registered, the users can create posts for the community-at-large to see in like a feed, while also being able to communicate directly to other users for whom they have information for (i.e. friends with). I think on a smaller scale it could be based on address. Users can also create events/groups and invite other users to join.

3. A Personal Dashboard. You can create/set tasks for yourself. Have a calendar and set reminders for events/days. Set locations as popular destinations and get weather
